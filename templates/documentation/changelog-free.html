<h4 id="updated-april-8-2022">Updated: April 8, 2022</h4>
<p>We are aware that our newest update to the Atlas theme introduced some issues and unexpected behavior. Features introduced in this update will help Atlas to be more usable, robust and stable in the future as we try to keep up with the latest tools that Hubspot provides for themes and templates. However, due to the nature of Hubspot CMS, changes like these are unavoidable.<br>We are really sorry for any inconvenience, but know that we are working closely with HubSpot right now to better understand the specifics and prevent situations like this moving forward.<br>We sincerely apologize. We know it&#39;s really frustrating when you are been negatively affected by any update. We&#39;re constantly learning how to better deliver and support high-value products for the HubSpot Community. Unfortunately, it sometimes comes at the cost of issues like these. We&#39;ve taken many learnings from this situation to heart and will adopt new processes into our development cycle to prevent issues like this from happening in the future.<br><strong>This will only affect users that were using an older version of Atlas and updated their theme to the new version.</strong><br><strong>New users (for both Atlas and Atlas Pro) WILL NOT be affected by these issues.</strong><br>Affected modules: (will update as we have more information)</p>
<ul>
<li>Navbar with Menu - Hovering the navbar items doesn&#39;t display the megamenu</li>
<li>Navbar with Menu - Anchoring items to the same page causes the items to be highlighted</li>
